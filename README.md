### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Owen, and this is where I keep anything vaguely useful that I have written in PowerShell.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the author of a book published by Apress: [Understanding Microsoft Intune - 
Deploying Applications Using PowerShell](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8850-4)

Thanks for dropping by!
